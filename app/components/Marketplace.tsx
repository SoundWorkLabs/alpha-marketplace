                    By minting and listing a Music NFT on Soundwork, musicians
                    are able to track when and where their sounds are being used
                    on the platformâ€™s Dashboard, and get rewarded for their
                    contributions in real time.

                    Music NFTs on Soundwork can be bought, sold, and leased,
                    which is a novel way to make use of the samples without
                    purchasing them directly.
